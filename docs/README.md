## Misc

### Policy ACLs

Headscale implements the same policy ACLs as Tailscale.com, adapted to the self-hosted environment.

For instance, instead of referring to users when defining groups you must
use namespaces (which are the equivalent to user/logins in Tailscale.com).

Please check https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/, and `./tests/acls/` in this repo for working examples.

### Apple devices

An endpoint with information on how to connect your Apple devices (currently macOS only) is available at `/apple` on your running instance.
